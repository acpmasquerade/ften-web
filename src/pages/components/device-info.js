  <h4> But What is this? </h4>
  <p>This application is for screenwriters, mostly for Indian screenwriters. It helps in two ways. </p>
  <ul> 
    <li>Some Indian screenplays are maintained in two forms. One, a transliteration form 
      so that they can be read by people who cannot read the native script. Two, a native version. Writing a screenplay itself is an arduous task in itself and maintaining two versions is a headache one wants to avoid. With this application, one can 'convert' from one form to another easily.
    </li>
    <li>
      The screenplay format -- at least for production -- used in India is also different than the Hollywood format. In the Indian version, the page is split in half vertically. The screen action is on the left and dialogs are on the right. The task of maintaining two versions typically befalls on an unpaid assistant director! This application helps generate an Indian format as needed.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> You can just have one script and generate the format you want and whenever you want.</p>
